# AI Content Detector

A Chrome extension that analyses webpages to detect the likelihood that content has been generated by AI.

![Extension Demo](https://img.shields.io/badge/version-1.0-blue.svg)
![Chrome Extension](https://img.shields.io/badge/platform-Chrome-green.svg)

## Features

- **Real-time Analysis**: Automatically analyses each webpage you visit
- **Visual Indicators**: Colour-coded badge showing AI likelihood (HIGH/MED/LOW/NONE)
- **Detailed Breakdown**: Popup interface with comprehensive analysis scores
- **Multi-factor Detection**: Uses multiple heuristics for accurate assessment
- **Content-focused**: Ignores navigation, adverts, and other non-content elements

## How It Works

The extension employs several detection methods to assess content:

### Detection Algorithms

- **Phrase Analysis**: Identifies overused AI phrases like "furthermore", "it is important to note", "in today's digital age"
- **Structure Analysis**: Detects overly consistent sentence patterns typical of AI writing
- **Personality Markers**: Looks for personal expressions that AI typically lacks
- **Repetition Detection**: Identifies unnatural word repetition patterns
- **Formal Language Patterns**: Spots excessive use of formal structures

### Scoring System

Each webpage receives a likelihood score (0-100%) based on weighted analysis:
- Phrase Score (30%)
- Structure Score (25%) 
- Personality Score (20%)
- Repetition Score (15%)
- Length Score (10%)

## Installation

### From Source

1. Clone or download this repository
2. Create icon files (see Icons section below)
3. Open Chrome and navigate to `chrome://extensions/`
4. Enable "Developer mode" in the top right corner
5. Click "Load unpacked" and select the extension folder
6. The extension will appear in your toolbar

### Icons Required

Create the following icon files in PNG format:
- `icon16.png` (16x16 pixels)
- `icon48.png` (48x48 pixels) 
- `icon128.png` (128x128 pixels)

You can use any icon design tool or AI image generator to create these.

## Usage

1. **Automatic Analysis**: The extension automatically analyses each webpage after loading
2. **Badge Indicator**: Check the coloured badge on the extension icon:
   - ðŸ”´ **HIGH**: 80%+ likelihood (Red)
   - ðŸŸ  **MED**: 60-79% likelihood (Orange)
   - ðŸŸ¡ **LOW**: 40-59% likelihood (Yellow)
   - ðŸŸ¢ **NONE**: <40% likelihood (Green)
3. **Detailed View**: Click the extension icon to view detailed analysis scores

### Permissions

- `activeTab`: Access current tab content
- `storage`: Store analysis results
- `<all_urls>`: Analyse content on all websites

### Browser Compatibility

- Chrome (Manifest V3)
- Other Chromium-based browsers (Edge, Brave, etc.)

## Limitations

- **Heuristic-based**: Uses pattern matching rather than machine learning
- **Content-dependent**: Requires sufficient text content (100+ characters)
- **Language-specific**: Optimised for English content
- **False positives**: May flag well-structured human writing as AI-generated
- **Context-agnostic**: Doesn't consider domain-specific writing styles

## Privacy

- **No data collection**: All analysis happens locally in your browser  
- **No external requests**: No data is sent to external servers
- **Temporary storage**: Analysis results are stored locally and not synced
